                  A person who breaks the law or does not follow any rules in this Act, or any rules of an association,
                  is responsible for any losses or damage that another person suffers because of this.
                  This also applies to any defenses in a court case for breaking a legal duty. A person who breaks the
                  law in sections 106 or 107 has to pay damages to any person who, because of this,
                  buys something at a higher price than they would have if the law had not been broken. The amount of
                  damages that this person has to pay is limited to twice the amount of money that
                  they gained or could have gained by breaking the law. An action for damages cannot be brought after
                  three years have passed since the law was broken. The registrar may bring a court case
                  to get damages for a loss on behalf of an investor or group of investors. This does not affect any
                  other liability that a person may have under the law, but any damages that have already
                  been awarded because of this must be taken into consideration in any future claim.</p>

                <p class="summaries">This section is about how the Companies Act affects managers. Except for when this
                  Act says otherwise, the Companies Act still applies to managers. This Act does not
                  change anything that the Companies Act says about managers, unless this Act says so explicitly. The
                  Companies Act does not apply to an open-ended investment company in the same way that
                  it would to other companies. This is because an open-ended investment company is a type of company
                  that allows people to buy and sell shares whenever they want to, rather than a set
                  number of times per year. The same goes for foreign collective investment schemes that have been
                  approved by the government. In the event that a manager is being wound up or has business
                  rescue proceedings against them, the registrar may request any accounts or documents from the
                  liquidator or business rescue practitioner that are required to be filed with the Companies
                  and Intellectual Property Commission or Master.</p>

              context, in relation to the business rescue of a manager whether or not it is a company.<br>

              affected person other than the registrar —<br>

              (a) it shall not be heard unless copies of the notice of motion and of all accompanying affidavits and

              application is set down for hearing;<br>

              been granted permission to do so by a court.<br>

                  registrar may start business rescue proceedings
                  if they think it is in the investors' best interests. This includes things like appointing a business
                  rescue practitioner and approving a business rescue plan. If somebody other
                  than the registrar tries to start business rescue proceedings, the registrar can join the proceedings
                  and try to stop them if they think it is not in the investors' best interests.
                  Once a business rescue practitioner has been appointed, they are not allowed to issue any new
                  participatory interests (pieces of the company that people can invest in) without
