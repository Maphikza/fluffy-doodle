            <p class="lead intro-body">This Act provides a framework for the regulation and supervision of insurance
                companies in South Africa. It also introduces a framework for microinsurance to promote financial
                inclusion. Finally, it replaces parts of the Long-term Insurance Act, 1998, and the Short-term Insurance
                Act, 1998.</p>

                                    agreement, unless that other law specifically says that agreement is not needed.

                            specifying the names of the parties to the merger and certifying that the merger is a merger
                            contemplated in subparagraph (i), and it is in the public interest that the merger is
                            subject
                            to the Financial Sector Regulation Act only. <br>

                            (b) Sections 13(6 ) and 14(2 ) of the Competition Act, 1998, do not apply to a merger in
                            respect of
                            which the Prudential Authority has issued a certificate contemplated in paragraph (a)(ii).

                            (c) For the purposes of paragraphs (a ) and (b), 'merger' means a merger as defined in

                                    This section explains that the rules about significant owners in the Financial
                                    Sector Regulation Act do not apply to foreign reinsurers, Lloyd's underwriters, or
                                    Lloyd's, but do apply to controlling companies. If an insurer or a controlling
                                    company becomes aware of an arrangement that would make someone a significant owner,
                                    they must notify the Prudential Authority within 30 days. The Prudential Authority
                                    can only approve the arrangement if they are satisfied that the person would not
                                    be harmful to the company or its policyholders. If the Prudential Authority decides
                                    that a significant owner is harmful to the company or its policyholders, they
                                    can direct the owner to take steps to limit their influence over the company.
                                    Finally, this section explains that no one may vote or receive money in respect of
                                    an
                                    interest in an insurer or a controlling company if they got that interest in a way

                                <p class="summaries">This section of the Act requires insurers and controlling companies
                                    to have procedures in place to identify any non-compliance with section 30,
                                    and in the case of a branch of a foreign reinsurer and Lloyd's, also with Part 2 of
                                    this Chapter and Part 2 of Chapter 6. If an insurer or a controlling company
                                    fails to comply with section 30, they must notify the Prudential Authority of the
                                    failure and the reasons for the failure, and submit a compliance scheme to
                                    the Prudential Authority for approval that sets out the measures that the insurer or
                                    controlling company will implement within a four-month period to remedy
                                    any non-compliance. The Prudential Authority may, if appropriate, extend the
                                    four-month period by two months and, in exceptional circumstances, extend that
                                    period by an appropriate period of time. An insurer or a controlling company whose
                                    compliance scheme was approved as contemplated in subsection (2) must submit
                                    a monthly progress report to the Prudential Authority that sets out the measures
                                    taken and the progress made with implementing the compliance scheme. The
                                    Prudential Authority may, until a compliance scheme is implemented, restrict or
                                    prohibit certain activities or transactions of the insurer or insurance group,
                                    or impose conditions or limitations on the insurer, controlling company, or board of
                                    directors of the insurer or controlling company. If the Prudential Authority
                                    reasonably believes that the effectiveness of the governance framework of an insurer
                                    or controlling company or a part thereof requires further investigation, the
                                    Prudential Authority may direct the insurer or controlling company to secure an
                                    independent review of the governance framework by a person to be approved by the
                                    Prudential Authority at the cost of the insurer or controlling company.</p>

                            insurer
                            or controlling company, insofar as any money belonging to the insurer or controlling company
                            has
                            been deposited into such latter banking account; <br>

                            (p) may open and operate any new banking accounts for the purposes of the curatorship; and

                            the

                            creditors of the insurer or controlling company and whether — <br>

                            (a) creditors are treated in an equitable manner; and <br>

                            (b) when acting under subsection (2)(e)(i), a reasonable probability exists that a creditor
                            will not incur

                            than
                            would have been incurred if the insurer or controlling company had been wound -up on the
                            date
                            of the proposed disposal, transfer or disposal and transfer. <br>

                            (4) A claim for damages in respect of any loss sustained by or damage caused to any person
                            as a result of
                            the cancellation of a guarantee referred to in subsection (2)(e)(ii), other than a guarantee
                            that constitutes
                            an insurance obligation under a life insurance policy, or provision of security, may be
                            instituted against
                            the insurer or controlling company after the expiration of a period of six months from the
                            date of the
                            cancellation. <br>

                            (5) An insurer or a controlling company may not begin or enter business rescue or be
                            wound-up while under
                            curatorship within the meaning of the Financial Institutions (Protection of Funds ) Act,
                            unless the curator
                            applies for the business rescue or winding-up.

                                    take over the management of an insurer or controlling company if it is in financial
                                    difficulty, without going through the court. The curator has all the powers that the
                                    shareholders or members of the company would normally have, including the power
                                    to make decisions, take control of assets and liabilities, and raise funding. The
                                    curator must act in the best interests of the policyholders and must keep the
                                    Prudential Authority informed of developments. The law also allows the curator to
                                    extend his or her powers to other companies in the group, if necessary. If the
                                    insurer or controlling company is wound up, the curator's expenses can be paid from

                                    This section is saying that Chapter 6 of the Companies Act applies to insurers and
                                    controlling companies, excluding any similar provisions under the Co-operatives Act
                                    or
                                    any other law. In this application, the Prudential Authority must be treated as an
                                    affected person. When Chapter 6 of the Companies Act is being applied to an insurer
                                    or
                                    controlling company, any references to the Commission must also include references
                                    to the Prudential Authority. Any references to creditors must also include
                                    references
                                    to the policyholders of the insurer. Any references relating to an insurer or
                                    controlling company's inability to pay all its debts must also relate to its
                                    inability to
                                    comply with the financial soundness requirements of this Act. In addition to any
                                    questions relating to the business of an insurer, it must also be considered if any
                                    proposed action is in the interests of policyholders of an insurer or, in the case

                                    it is in the interests of the policyholders to do so. If an application for business
